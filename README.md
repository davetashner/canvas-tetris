Tetris Cloud Server Deployment

The setup-tetris-server.py script automates the deployment of a Tetris web game on an AWS EC2 instance with a custom DNS name and SSL certificate.

*Features*

‚úÖ Deploys a Tetris game to an AWS EC2 instance.

‚úÖ Uses a custom subdomain (e.g., tetris.mydomain.com).

‚úÖ Configures HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt SSL.

‚úÖ Creates necessary AWS resources:

	‚Ä¢	Security group
	‚Ä¢	IAM role with S3 read permissions
	‚Ä¢	Route 53 DNS record

‚úÖ Waits for DNS propagation and SSL activation.

Prerequisites
	‚Ä¢	AWS CLI configured with the required credentials.

	‚Ä¢	A Route 53 hosted zone for managing the DNS records.

	‚Ä¢	A valid public domain (e.g., mydomain.com).

Potential Improvements:

	1.	Reduce Redundant Code
	‚Ä¢	Functions such as wait_for_instance_profile() and create_iam_role() include multiple nested checks for IAM entities. Some parts can be refactored into reusable utilities.
	
    2.	Enhanced Logging
	‚Ä¢	More structured output (e.g., success messages, status updates) can improve debugging and user experience.
	
    3.	Configurable Parameters
	‚Ä¢	Some hardcoded values like REGION, INSTANCE_TYPE, and HOSTED_ZONE_ID could be configurable via a .env file or command-line options.


Usage

1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Deployment

python3 setup-tetris-server.py --dns my-tetris

This will:
	‚Ä¢	Launch a Tetris server at my-tetris.mydomain.com
	‚Ä¢	Configure SSL via Let‚Äôs Encrypt.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically update the Route 53 DNS record.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Test Only DNS Health Check

If you only want to test whether the DNS has propagated:

python3 setup-tetris-server.py --dns my-tetris --test-dns

How It Works
	1.	Fetches the latest Ubuntu AMI.
	2.	Creates an EC2 instance with:
	‚Ä¢	A security group allowing HTTP and HTTPS access from the Internet.
	3.	Bootstraps the instance with:
	‚Ä¢	Tetris installation (cloned from GitHub).
	‚Ä¢	Nginx configuration to serve the game.
	‚Ä¢	Let‚Äôs Encrypt SSL setup.
	4.	Waits for DNS propagation before finalizing.
	5.	Outputs the public URL once ready.

Example Output

Fetching latest Ubuntu AMI...
Using latest Ubuntu AMI: ami-0abc123xyz
Creating security group...
Security group tetris-sg configured.
Launching EC2 instance...
EC2 Instance launched with ID: i-0123456789abcdef0
Waiting for DNS propagation...
‚úÖ DNS resolved: my-tetris.mydomain.com -> 3.15.27.5
Requesting SSL certificate...
‚úÖ SSL activated! Access Tetris at: https://tetris.mydomain.com

Troubleshooting

1Ô∏è‚É£ If the DNS check fails:
	‚Ä¢	Wait a few minutes and re-run with --test-dns.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure your Route 53 hosted zone is properly configured.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If SSL setup fails:
	‚Ä¢	Check if the server is reachable via HTTP before retrying.

3Ô∏è‚É£ To manually check the server status:

curl -I https://tetris.mydomain.com

Future Improvements

üîπ Add auto-scaling support for handling high traffic.
üîπ Store configurations in a .env file for better customization.
üîπ Improve logging output for better debugging.
